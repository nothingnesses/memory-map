### To do
- [ ] Move configuration (URLs, environment variables) to ".env".
- [ ] Use web server ([ferron](https://github.com/ferronweb/ferron)/caddy) to reverse proxy to URL.
- [ ] Get someone good to code review this.
- [ ] `justfile` should read .env to determine whether to build in debug or release mode.
